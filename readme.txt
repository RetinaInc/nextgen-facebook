Adds Facebook HTML meta tags to webpage headers, including featured images.
Also includes optional Like and Send Facebook buttons.

== Description ==

The NextGEN Facebook plugin adds Facebook Open Graph HTML meta tags to all
webpage headers. Featured image thumbnails from a NextGEN Gallery or Media
Library are included in the image meta tag. The plugin also includes an option
to add Like and Send Facebook buttons to your Posts and Pages.

NextGEN Facebook was specifically written to support featured images located
in a NextGEN Gallery, but works just as well with the WordPress Media Library.
<em>The NextGEN Gallery plugin is not required - all features work just as
well without it.</em>

The image used in the Open Graph meta tag will be determined in this sequence;
a featured image from a NextGEN Gallery or WordPress Media Library, the first
NextGEN [singlepic] or IMG HTML tag in the content, a default image defined in
the plugin settings. If none of these conditions can be satisfied, then the
Open Graph image tag will be left empty.

And example of the meta tags generated by NextGEN Facebook:

<code>
&lt;!-- NextGEN Facebook Plugin Open Graph Tags: BEGIN --&gt;
&lt;meta property="fb:admins" content="" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="fb:app_id" content="" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="Title of a WordPress Post" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:type" content="article" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image" content="http://trtms.com/wp-content/gallery/cache/136_crop_200x200_featured-image-filename.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:site_name" content="The Road to Myself" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="A short amount of text, taken from the excerpt or content, that's used by Facebook when displaying the like or share information box." /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:url" content="http://trtms.com/2012/06/24/title-of-a-wordpress-post/" /&gt;
&lt;!-- NextGEN Facebook Plugin Open Graph Tags: END --&gt;
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Why doesn't Facebook's send / share show my featured image? =

A. The first time Facebook accesses your webpage, it will cache the image and
text it finds. Facebook will then prefer to use that cached information, until
the information has expired from it's cache. So, before you hit the send /
share button for the first time, make sure you've defined your featured image
and (optionally) the excerpt text. If you change your mind, and your webpage
has not been liked or shared yet, then try waiting a few hours before trying
again. If your webpage has already been liked or shared on Facebook, then
there's nothing you can do to change the image, text, or title that was used.

== Changelog ==

= v1.2 =
* Added the Default Image ID option, in addition to the existing Default Image URL option. Since the plugin can find images by ID number, might as well use it for the default image as well. :)

= v1.1 =
* Improved the description and installation texts.
* Used a single screenshot image of the settings page, instead of two.
* Removed the "NextGEN Gallery Image Size" setting - it was a bit redundant. Instead, I've suggested using an existing Size Name from the Media Library, and if necessary, to create an additional Size Name specifically for NextGEN Facebook. Since NextGEN Gallery doesn't understand these Size Names, I've added some code to get the width, height, and crop from the Size Name, before calling the necessary NextGEN Gallery functions.
* Added a "Use Default on Multi-Entry Pages" checkbox to force the default image to be used on the homepage, category page, author page, etc. (instead of the featured image from the first post, for example).
* Added extra parsing for author pages, tag pages, category pages, etc., to refine the og:description text.
* Also improved the og:title text for archive pages, category pages, etc. 
* No bugs were reported or fixed from the previous version, which is good news I guess. ;-)

= v1.0 =
* Initial release.
