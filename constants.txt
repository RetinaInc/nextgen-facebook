PHP Constants for NextGEN Facebook Open Graph

To address very specific needs, some PHP constants for NGFB may be defined in
your wp-config.php or template files (generally before the wp_head() function
call). 

NGFB_HTML_DEBUG

	Set this constant to 'true' to turn on hidden debug messages, and use
	"View Source" on any webpage to view the debug messages. An
	informational message box will also be displayed in admin pages as
	reminder that debug mode is on.

NGFB_WP_DEBUG

	Send debug messages to PHP's error_log() as well.

NGFB_DEBUG_FILE_EXP

	Cache file expiration time in seconds when debug mode is enabled
	(defaults is 300 seconds).

NGFB_RESET

	Set this contant to 'true' to reset all options to their defaults when
	the plugin is activated.

NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to prevent the plugin from adding Open
	Graph meta tags in the webpage head section.

NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to disable the minimum width and height
	checks for the <img/> attributes in the content. All images, no matter
	their size, will be added to the Open Graph meta tags. See "Why does
	NGFB ignore the <img/> HTML tags in my content?" on the FAQ page
	for additional information.

NGFB_OBJECT_CACHE_DISABLE
NGFB_TRANSIENT_CACHE_DISABLE
NGFB_FILE_CACHE_DISABLE

	Disable one or more types of cache.

NGFB_META_NAME
NGFB_OPTIONS_NAME
NGFB_SITE_OPTIONS_NAME

	The options field names in the database for NGFB. The default values
	are '_ngfb_meta', 'ngfb_options', and 'ngfb_site_options'.

NGFB_MENU_PRIORITY

	Adjust the location of the "Open Graph" menu (default is 99.10).

NGFB_INIT_PRIORITY

	The plugin initialization priority (default is 12)

NGFB_HEAD_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority of the method that adds JavaScript and
	Open Graph meta tags to the head section (default is 10).

NGFB_SOCIAL_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority for the method that adds social buttons
	to the content (default is 100).

NGFB_FOOTER_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority for the method that adds JavaScript to
	the footer section (default is 100).

NGFB_CURL_DISABLE

	Disable all use of PHP's curl functions (all NGFB file caching
	features will be disabled).

NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT

	Used by the remote content caching feature for social button images
	and JavaScript. The Google+ JavaScript is different for (what Google
	considers) invalid user agents. Since crawlers and robots might
	refresh the cached files, the NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT defines a default
	user agent string. You may define a NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT constant in
	your wp-config.php file to change the default NGFB uses.

NGFB_CURL_CAINFO

	When the "Verify SSL Certificates" option is checked, PHP's curl
	function needs a certificate authority file. Define the
	NGFB_CURL_CAINFO constant in your wp-config.php file to change the
	default location used by NGFB.

NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD

	In order to share embedded videos from Wistia, you must define your
	Wistia API password (see the Account Dashboard -> API Settings on
	Wistia).
