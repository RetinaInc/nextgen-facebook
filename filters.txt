Filters were intriduced in NGFB Open Graph Pro in version 5.1.

Filter functions in NGFB are called with a single argument. Using the WordPress
example from http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter, the
$accepted_args parameter should always be "1" for NGFB filters.

	 <?php add_filter( $tag, $function_to_add, $priority, $accepted_args ); ?> 

Here is an example from the NGFB readme.txt:

	add_filter( 'ngfb_tags', 'uwf_filter_ngfb_tags', 10, 1 );

	function uwf_filter_ngfb_tags( $tags = array() ) {
	        foreach ( $tags as $num => $tag_name ) {
	                $tag_name = preg_replace( "/^wiki-/", '', $tag_name );
	                $tags[$num] = $tag_name;
	        }
	        return $tags;
	}
